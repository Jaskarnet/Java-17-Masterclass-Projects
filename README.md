- [`ElectricCar`](https://github.com/Jaskarnet/Java-17-Masterclass-Projects/blob/main/007%20-%20PolymorphismChallenge/src/Car.java)

#### **ðŸ“– Project Description**  
This project demonstrates the use of polymorphism in Java. It simulates a car race where different types of cars, including a regular `Car`, `GasPoweredCar`, and `ElectricCar`, perform actions like starting the engine and driving. The program uses polymorphism to call methods that are overridden in the subclasses. The `Car` class is the superclass, while `GasPoweredCar` and `ElectricCar` extend it and modify specific behaviors related to starting the engine and driving the car.

#### **ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways**  
- **Polymorphism**: Enables one method (`runRace`) to interact with different car types (`Car`, `GasPoweredCar`, `ElectricCar`) by using overridden methods.
- **Method Overriding**: Subclasses customize behaviors like `startEngine` and `runEngine`.
- **Constructor Overloading**: Allows creating cars with different properties, such as fuel consumption or battery size.

### 12. Abstract Classes

#### **ðŸ“‚ Classes**
- [ArtObject](https://github.com/Jaskarnet/Java-17-Masterclass-Projects/blob/main/012%20-%20AbstractChallenge/src/net/jaskar/ArtObject.java)
- [Furniture](https://github.com/Jaskarnet/Java-17-Masterclass-Projects/blob/main/012%20-%20AbstractChallenge/src/net/jaskar/Furniture.java)
- [OrderItem](https://github.com/Jaskarnet/Java-17-Masterclass-Projects/blob/main/012%20-%20AbstractChallenge/src/net/jaskar/OrderItem.java)
- [ProductForSale](https://github.com/Jaskarnet/Java-17-Masterclass-Projects/blob/main/012%20-%20AbstractChallenge/src/net/jaskar/ProductForSale.java)
- [Store](https://github.com/Jaskarnet/Java-17-Masterclass-Projects/blob/main/012%20-%20AbstractChallenge/src/net/jaskar/Store.java)

#### **ðŸ“– Description**
Simulates a store with products like art and furniture. Products extend the abstract class `ProductForSale`, each providing details through the `showDetails()` method.

#### **ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways**
- **Abstract Classes**: Like interfaces, abstract classes cannot be instantiated but can contain both abstract and concrete methods.
- **Fields**: Abstract classes can have instance fields (non-static, non-final), unlike interfaces.
- **Access Modifiers**: Abstract classes allow access modifiers for both concrete and abstract methods (except private for abstract methods).
- **Single Inheritance**: Abstract classes can extend only one class but can implement multiple interfaces.
- **Subclass Implementation**: Subclasses must implement all abstract methods unless they are also abstract.

#### **ðŸ›  When to Use an Abstract Class**
- Share common code and fields among closely related classes (e.g., `Animal` with `name`, `age`).
- Provide default behavior for methods, with the flexibility for subclasses to override.
- Define non-static, non-final fields to manage object state (e.g., `name`, `age`).
- Allow subclasses to provide specific implementations for certain methods while sharing common behavior.

### 13. Interface Challenge

#### **ðŸ“‚ Classes**
- [Building](https://github.com/Jaskarnet/Java-17-Masterclass-Projects/blob/main/013%20-%20InterfaceChallenge/src/net/jaskar/Building.java)
- [Main](https://github.com/Jaskarnet/Java-17-Masterclass-Projects/blob/main/013%20-%20InterfaceChallenge/src/net/jaskar/Main.java)
- [Mappable](https://github.com/Jaskarnet/Java-17-Masterclass-Projects/blob/main/013%20-%20InterfaceChallenge/src/net/jaskar/Mappable.java)
- [UtilityLine](https://github.com/Jaskarnet/Java-17-Masterclass-Projects/blob/main/013%20-%20InterfaceChallenge/src/net/jaskar/UtilityLine.java)

#### **ðŸ“– Description**
The project demonstrates the use of an interface Mappable for different types of objects like buildings and utility lines. Each class implements the Mappable interface, providing specific behavior for labeling, shapes, markers, and JSON formatting.

#### **ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways**
- **Interfaces**: An interface defines the "what" (methods) an object can do, without providing the implementation details. Classes that implement the interface must provide the implementation for these methods.
- **Contract**: Interfaces form a contract between the class and the outside world, ensuring that the class will provide certain methods.
- **Instantiating Interfaces**: Interfaces cannot be instantiated. They define methods without implementation (implicitly `public abstract`), but can also include default methods with implementation and static methods.
- **Extending Interfaces**: An interface can extend another interface, creating a hierarchy of behaviors.
- **Decoupling**: Interfaces decouple the "what" from the "how," allowing you to plug in different implementations.

#### **ðŸ›  When to Use an Interface**
- When you expect that unrelated classes will implement your interface (e.g., `Comparable`, `Cloneable`).
- When you want to specify behavior for a data type without concern for who implements it.
- When you need to separate behavior (e.g., implementing common behavior across different classes that are not in the same class hierarchy).
